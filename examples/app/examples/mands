I realise this is my fault for not checking but I've just bought what I thought was a lovely, bready (I know that's not a word) sandwich from your store. When I got back to work I found out that not only had I ended up paying £4 for a chicken salad sandwich but it's bloody gluten free!! Gluten free = tastes rubbish. I don't want gluten free bread. I like bread to be bread. The kind made with wheat. 

May I suggest that if you going to start making a special range of food for people with allergies that you keep all their products together, maybe in a special allergy free corner of the store. Not mix them up with food for the rest of us. That way I won't end up buy a rubbish sandwich by accident and then feel sad for the rest of the day because I've just wasted £4 on something I didn't want to eat. I would have taken it back if wasn't too lazy to walk back to the store.

I would say I'll never shop in your store again but that would be a lie as the food is so tasty.

So to summarise. Everyone seems to have allergies these days and they are trying to ruin my lunch. And you're not helping by making them sandwiches. Really, who's allergic to bread. I think they just like the attention. I tell you what. I can only eat peas grown in Peru. Nothing else. Is there any chance you can make a range of sandwiches for me which are entirely made from Peruvian peas. And don't go trying to sell me a bag of peas. I want pea bread, pea mayonnaise, chicken made from peas and pea lettuce. And then can you mix the range of Pea sandwiches up with everyone else's sandwiches, so some poor office worker gets back to his desk and finds out he's got peas for lunch.

Many thanks
